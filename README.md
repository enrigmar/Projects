# Projects
This is a collection of projects to demonstrate my technical abilities and creative skills. Many of the projects were designed and/or partially implemented by University of Washington professors and teaching assistants for teaching purposes. Please refer to the comments within the project code for specific authors. Thanks for taking a look! -Margot
