# This project was part of a course designed by Jeffrey Heer and other members of the CSE442 staff at the Univeristy of Washington. 
The project includes two visuals, one that transparently communicates information from a dataset, and another that deceptively misleads viewers into incorrect 
perceptions using the same set of data. The graphics are encoded using Vega-Lite, a grammar of interactive graphics created by Jeffrey Heer and others. This project was 
created and built by myself, Margot Enright-Down.
